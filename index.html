                <p>My name is Samuel Todd Williams and I currently reside in Tifton, Ga.  I attended Valdosta State University for my undergraduate studies and then went to University of North Florida for my graduate degree. </p><p> Professionally I have worked as a project Manager for the past 14 years with many of my projects in technology as opposed to operations.  More recently, i have assumed additional responsibilities as a SharePoint Developer where I have a had a brief introduction in web development technologies.  I hope to use this course to expand my knowledge in this area.</p><p> Outside of work I enjoy outdoor activities especially hiking and Kayaking.  I also like to travel to attend music shows as you can see in my false 'portfolio.</p>
